          An amaizing stress buster and weekend chill. We had a 2hr workshop
          session at Clay7Studio and we enjoyed our time like nothing else. We
          had a clay, cofee and cretivity. The instructor is pretty amazing, she
          was too much friendy. It was a feeling of home away from our home.

          my bestfriend, we talked a lot and spend good time.

          I attended the handmade pottery workshop of two hours with my
          boyfriend and had such a fun time. The teacher was very sweet, she
          helped wherever necessary but also let us do our own thing. Would love
          it if we could also use glazes instead of paints on our handmade
          pottery. A few of the colours I wanted within the paints were out of
          stock too so we worked with a very limited palette. That being said,
          the overall output has been very good, definitely recommend it :D

          Made this two wonderful pieces on a pottery wheel. This place has an
          amazing vibe and the staff is helpful and cooperative. They patiently
          helped me throughout and corrected me whenever required. Thanks
