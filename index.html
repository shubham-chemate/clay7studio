          An amaizing stress buster and weekend chill. We had a 2hr workshop
          session at Clay7Studio and we enjoyed our time like nothing else. We
          had a clay, cofee and cretivity. The instructor is pretty amazing, she
          was too much friendy. It was a feeling of home away from our home.

          my bestfriend, we talked a lot and spend good time.

          I attended the handmade pottery workshop of two hours with my
          boyfriend and had such a fun time. The teacher was very sweet, she
          helped wherever necessary but also let us do our own thing. Would love
          it if we could also use glazes instead of paints on our handmade
          pottery. A few of the colours I wanted within the paints were out of
          stock too so we worked with a very limited palette. That being said,
          the overall output has been very good, definitely recommend it :D

          Made this two wonderful pieces on a pottery wheel. This place has an
          amazing vibe and the staff is helpful and cooperative. They patiently
          helped me throughout and corrected me whenever required. Thanks

          My friends and I decided to do a pottery class while in town and
          stumbled upon Clay7 Studio and we are so happy we did. Would recommend
          to anyone wanted to learn the basics of pottery and have a try or
          creating something youself.

          I recently attended a wheel pottery session and it was an absolute
          blast! The guidance provided by the instructor was exceptional, making
          it easy for beginners to follow along and get the hang of things
          quickly. The hands-on experience was both challenging and rewarding,
          and the atmosphere was filled with creativity and excitement. It's a
          perfect blend of learning and fun, and I would highly recommend it to
          anyone looking to try something new. Whether you're a seasoned artist
          or a complete novice, this is a must-do experience that you'll
          thoroughly enjoy!

          Such a wonderful experience. The session was well-organized,
          informative, and incredibly enjoyable. A special thanks to Deepa for
          her exceptional guidance and patience.
